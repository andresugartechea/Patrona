# Decoding Nature | Final project: "Patrona", interactive artwork by Andres Ugartechea

## Project description:

Patrona is the title of both an interactive artwork and a painting. As an interactive artwork, a program on a computer displays the photograph of a woman scooping coffee and a colorful background showing a distorted image from the user’s web camera. The piece takes forms as a painting with oil on a 9 by 12 inches canvas depicting a similar image as the interactive artwork. With the subtitle « I believe in the Creator’s computer », Patrona presents itself as a representation of the origin of life.
